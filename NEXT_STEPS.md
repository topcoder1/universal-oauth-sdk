## 🚀 Next Steps (Do These Manually)

### Step 1: Create GitHub Repository

You need to create the repository on GitHub. You have two options:

**Option A: Using GitHub CLI (if installed)**
```bash
gh repo create universal-oauth-sdk --public --source=. --remote=origin
git push -u origin master
```

**Option B: Manual (Recommended)**
1. Go to https://github.com/new
2. Repository name: `universal-oauth-sdk`
3. Description: "Universal OAuth 2.0 SDK with PKCE, device flow, and token encryption"
4. Make it **Public**
5. **DO NOT** initialize with README (we already have one)
6. Click "Create repository"
7. Then run:
```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/topcoder1/universal-oauth-sdk.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

### Step 2: Publish to npm

**IMPORTANT**: You need to be logged into npm first.

```bash
# Login to npm (you'll need your npm account)
npm login

# Then publish all packages
cd c:\dev_apps\universal-oauth-sdk
pnpm publish -r --access public
```

This will publish:
- @oauth-kit/sdk
- @oauth-kit/cli
- @oauth-kit/provider-catalog
- @oauth-kit/manifest-tools

### Step 3: Create Git Tag

```bash
git tag -a v1.0.0 -m "Release v1.0.0"
git push origin v1.0.0
```

### Step 4: Create GitHub Release

1. Go to https://github.com/topcoder1/universal-oauth-sdk/releases
2. Click "Create a new release"
3. Choose tag: v1.0.0
4. Title: "v1.0.0 - Initial Release"
5. Copy description from CHANGELOG.md
6. Click "Publish release"

## ⚠️ Important Notes

### npm Account Required
You need an npm account to publish. If you don't have one:
1. Go to https://www.npmjs.com/signup
2. Create an account
3. Verify your email
4. Then run `npm login`

### Package Names
Your packages will be published as:
- `@oauth-kit/sdk`
- `@oauth-kit/cli`
- `@oauth-kit/provider-catalog`
- `@oauth-kit/manifest-tools`

If the `@oauth-kit` scope is already taken, you may need to:
1. Choose a different scope (e.g., `@topcoder1/sdk`)
2. Or publish without a scope (e.g., `oauth-kit-sdk`)
