# Universal OAuth SDK - Long-Term Vision

## Mission Statement

**"Make OAuth authentication simple, secure, and accessible to every developer."**

We believe OAuth should be a solved problem. Developers shouldn't waste days implementing the same authentication flows over and over. Universal OAuth SDK provides a focused, lightweight library that does one thing exceptionally well: OAuth authentication.

---

## Core Philosophy

### 1. **Simplicity Over Complexity**
- OAuth is complex enough. The SDK should be simple.
- One npm install. No external services. No vendor lock-in.
- Clear, focused API that developers can understand in minutes.

### 2. **Developer Autonomy**
- You own your code, your data, your infrastructure.
- No black boxes. Open source and transparent.
- Full control over security and compliance.

### 3. **Library, Not Platform**
- We're a library that embeds in your app, not a platform you depend on.
- No external services required. No network calls to third parties.
- Your app, your rules.

### 4. **Free Forever**
- No freemium. No usage limits. No hidden costs.
- Apache-2.0 license ensures it stays free.
- Community-driven development.

## Strategic Positioning

### What We Are
✅ **The Simple OAuth Library**
- Focused on OAuth authentication
- Lightweight and fast
- Zero external dependencies
- Full developer control

### What We're Not
❌ **Not an Integration Platform** (that's Nango, Merge, etc.)
❌ **Not a Data Syncing Service**
❌ **Not a Managed Infrastructure**
❌ **Not a Webhook Handler**

### Our Niche
We serve developers who need **just OAuth authentication** without the complexity and cost of full integration platforms.
